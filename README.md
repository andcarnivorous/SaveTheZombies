## The game

Ok, so... You are one of the last zombies on earth. Zombie hunters, mages and knights want to kill the last of you (it's like a different earth, ok? There are mages here).

Keep them from reaching the last Zombie outpost by spitting your zombie-stomach acids on them. You can also disintegrate a ton of them with a spit bomb, you don't have much of those though.

Don't let them touch you or they will instantly kill you regardless of your life points (you get life points with each kill).
Some enemies deal more damage than others.

Collect the bonuses.

You are not gonna win, but you can try your best. That's all grandpa Zombus asks of you.
